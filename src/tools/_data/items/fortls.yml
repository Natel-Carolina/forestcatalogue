description: Process automation of point cloud data derived from terrestrial-based technologies such as Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). 'FORTLS' enables (i) detection of trees and estimation of tree-level attributes (e.g. diameters and heights), (ii) estimation of stand-level variables (e.g. density, basal area, mean and dominant height), (iii) computation of metrics related to important forest attributes estimated in Forest Inventories (FIs) at stand-level, and (iv) optimization of plot design for combining TLS data and field measured data. Documentation about 'FORTLS' is described in Molina-Valero et al.
