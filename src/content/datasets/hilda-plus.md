description: >-
  HILDA+ (HIstoric Land Dynamics Assessment+) is a global dataset on annual land use/cover change between 1960-2019 at 1 km spatial resolution. It is based on a data-driven reconstruction approach and integrates multiple open data streams (from high-resolution remote sensing, long-term land use reconstructions and statistics). It covers six generic land use/cover categories: 1: Urban areas, 2: Cropland, 3: Pasture/rangeland, 4: Forest, 5: Unmanaged grass/shrubland, 6: Sparse/no vegetation.
