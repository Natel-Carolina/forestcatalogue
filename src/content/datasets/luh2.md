title: Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2) - Harmonized Global Land Use v.2
ext_url: https://luh.umd.edu/data.shtml
description: Land-Use Harmonization data set includes 0.25-degree gridded, global maps of fractional land-use states, transitions, and management practices for the period 0850-2100. It includes land-use change data relating to agricultural expansion, deforestation, wood harvesting, shifting cultivation, afforestation, and crop rotations. The goal of the Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2) project is to prepare a harmonized set of land-use scenarios that smoothly connects the historical reconstructions of land-use with the future projections in the format required for ESMs. The land-use harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land-use patterns, underlying land-use transitions, and key agricultural management information, annually for the time period 850-2100 at 0.25 x 0.25 resolution, while minimizing the differences at the transition between the historical reconstruction ending conditions and IAM initial conditions, and working to preserve changes depicted by the IAMs in the future.
