Our aim is to provide a curated list of datasets, tools and models related to forests. 

By bringing together data from a variety of sources, we hope to create a platform that makes it easier to find all kinds of forest data for your projects. 

We believe that access to reliable and up-to-date forest data is essential for making informed decisions about forest protection and management.

This catalogue contains data on local, regional and global observations of biodiversity, carbon, wildfire, ecosystem services and more. 

We will also present a range of tools to help you explore forest data, including open-access GitHub repositories, libraries and visualisation platforms. 

From time to time we will publish articles on analysing datasets, and other forest data resources.

As we continue to develop our website, we will be adding new datasets and tools. 
Please feel free to add your favourite datasets via a [pull request](https://github.com/Natel-Carolina/forestcatalogue/pulls) or by email (carolina.natel at gmail [dot] com).

Have fun!
