# Forest Catalogue

A curated catalogue of open-source data on forests.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ collection/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ post.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Astro looks for `.md` files in the `src/content/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name under the collection.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory, or in `src/assets` to take advantage of image optimisation.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
